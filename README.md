<strong><a href="https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack">Haystack</a></strong> is an open source NLP framework by
<strong><a href="https://deepset.ai">deepset</a></strong> to help you build production ready search systems or
applications powered by various NLP tasks such as Question Answering. Haystack is designed to help you build systems
that work intelligently over large document collections. It achieves this with the concept of
<strong>Pipelines</strong> consisting of various <strong>Nodes</strong> such as a <strong>DocumentStore</strong>,
a <strong>Retriever</strong> and a <strong>Reader</strong>.

This repository contains fully working applications that demonstrate how to use Haystack to implement common NLP use
cases: some of these applications are available online and all of them can run locally.
